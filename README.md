Overview
=======
Carthage Rome Battle is application that simulates chess board with pieces replaced with warriors of Rome and Carthage.
It's only purpose was to complete an school assignment and therefore it kind of sucks.
Basically I took code from my other not finished at the time project - ChessDB and modified it to fit requirements.
I was responsible for coding and my mate Jajo did all graphics.

Features
=======
> - Moving pieces around a board, such as you can't move your pieces on top of one another. 
> - Pieces bind to the center of the squares
> - Sprites as graphics
> - Capturing pieces and adding new Pieces
> 
Things that should be improved
=======
> - Code is a mess
> - There should be game logic
> - Sprites are ugly
> - Toolbar with some options would be really nice

Future
=======
I don't intend to do anything with this project - **ever**.
Sole purpose as I said in an overview was to complete an assignment and as expectations were met I am happy with the result.
